# Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to the **Data Structures and Algorithms** repository! This repository is designed to contain a collection of solutions, implementations, and explanations for various data structures and algorithms.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

The repository is structured into different categories based on the type of problems and algorithms. Each category has well-organized code files with problem descriptions, algorithms, and solutions.

- **Fixed_Size_Window**  
  This folder contains problems and solutions related to the fixed-size sliding window technique.
  - `Max_Sum_SubArray_of_Size_k.py`: Python implementation to find the maximum sum of a subarray of size `k` using a sliding window approach.

- **Variable_Size_Window**  
  This folder contains problems and solutions that involve a variable-sized sliding window approach. (Details can be added as the repository grows.)

## üöÄ Features

- **Comprehensive Algorithms**: Solutions to common algorithmic problems using Python.
- **Well-Organized Code**: Clear and structured code following best practices.
- **Algorithm Categories**: Organized by techniques and data structures for easy navigation.
  
## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for all algorithm implementations.
- **Git**: Version control to manage the repository.
